# Order Matching Engine

A simple Java-based order matching system that simulates buyers and sellers placing trade orders. Matches are made when a buyer's price meets or exceeds a seller's price.

## How it works

- Buyers post orders like "buy Book A at $10"
- Sellers post orders like "sell Book A at $8"
- If there's a match, a trade occurs at the seller's price

## Use Case

This could be adapted for a platform like Carousell to match buyers and sellers based on price criteria.

## How to Run

Compile:
```bash
javac src/OrderMatchingEngine.java
